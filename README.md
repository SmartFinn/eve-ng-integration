# EVE-NG Integration [![releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/smartfinn/eve-ng-integration.svg)](https://github.com/SmartFinn/eve-ng-integration/releases)

This repo contains the equivalent of EVE-NG (aka UNetLab) [Windows Client Side Pack](http://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/downloads/windows-client-side-pack) for Ubuntu/Debian and other Linux distros.

Currently supports the following URL schemes:

* `telnet://`
* `capture://`
* `docker://`
* `vnc://` _(via Vinagre)_

Includes a script to work with .rdp files that are generated by EVE-NG.

## Known issues

1. #### Error `Couldn't run /usr/bin/dumpcap in child process: Permission denied` when starting Wireshark

    Add your user to `wireshark` group:

    ```
    sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER
    ```

    If you use a Debian-like distro, you can run the next command and choose answer as `Yes`:

    ```
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
    ```

    You will need to log out and then log back in again for this change to take effect.

2. #### Error `End of file on pipe magic during open` when starting Wireshark

    Install `ssh-askpass` package for your distro, or setup SSH key-based authentication with EVE-NG (UNetLab) machine.

3. #### Click on a node does not open an app (opens another app) in all browsers

    Execute the following commands to set the `eve-ng-integration.desktop` as default handler for telnet, capture, and docker URL schemes:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications/
    xdg-mime default eve-ng-integration.desktop x-scheme-handler/capture
    xdg-mime default eve-ng-integration.desktop x-scheme-handler/telnet
    xdg-mime default eve-ng-integration.desktop x-scheme-handler/docker
    xdg-mime default eni-rdp-wrapper.desktop application/x-rdp
    ```

4. #### Does not work in Google Chrome but works in another browser

    Quit Chrome and reset protocol handler with the command:

    ```bash
    sed -i.orig 's/"\(telnet\|capture\|docker\)":\(true\|false\),\?//g' "$HOME/.config/google-chrome/Default/Preferences"
    ```

    **NOTE**: Path to the `Preferences` file will be different for Chromium and other Chromium-based browsers.

5. #### Does not work in Firefox but works in another browser

    Go to `Preferences → Applications` (or paste `about:preferences#applications` in your address bar) and change Action to `Always ask` for telnet, capture and docker Content Types.

6. #### Firefox says `The address wasn't understood` when you clicked on a node

    - Type `about:config` into the Location Bar (address bar) and press Enter.
    - Right-click → New → Boolean → Name: `network.protocol-handler.expose.telnet` → Value → `false` (Repeat this for each supported protocol)
    - Next time you click a link of protocol-type foo you will be asked which application to open it with.

7. #### Chrome/Chromium downloads RDP files instead of opening

    To make RDP file open on your browser, instead of downloading, you have to download the file type once, then right after that download, look at the status bar at the bottom of the browser. Click the arrow next to that file and choose "Always open files of this type". Done.
